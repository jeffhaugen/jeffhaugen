        <p>This book has become one of, if not my favorite leadership book of all time. It’s an easy read that is very applicable, and Sinek provides plenty of real-world examples that inspires you to take action within your own leadership position.</p>
        <p>In Start With Why, Sinek explains the importance of knowing your WHY behind what you do, Sinek states, <q>people don’t buy what you do, they buy why you do it.</q></p>
